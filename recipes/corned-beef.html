                    <!-- just wanted to write a comment :P -->
                    <li>In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the onions and bell pepper. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes, until the onion is translucent and softened.</li>
                    <li>Add the corned beef, and potatoes, and stir everything together. Then use a spatula to press down and flatten the ingredients in the pan. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes without stirring so that the bottom gets crispy and browned. </li>
                    <li>Use a spatula to flip the hash over and cook the other side for another couple of minutes. Stir in the parsley, salt, and pepper. </li>
                </ol>
